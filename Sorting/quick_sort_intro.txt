/*
 * 1. Divide and Conquer Algo
 * 2. Worst Case Time: O(n^2)
 * 3. Despite O(n^2) worst case, it is considered faster because of the
 * following reasons:
 * a. In-Place - uses aux space to recursion call , doesn't use for copy element
 * b. Cache friendly - works on same array and more item in cache
 * c. Average case in O(nlogn)
 * d. Tail Recursive - if a recursive function does a recursive call as a last
 * thing than that function is tail recursive
 * 4. Partition in key function(Naive(Stable in quick sort), Lomuto(Unstable),
 * Hoare(Unstable))
 */

 if you don't need stability - Quick sort is best
 if you need stability - Merge Sort is prefered
